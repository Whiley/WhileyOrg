Another update to the Whiley compiler has just been released.  This is a fairly small update, consisting primarily of bug fixes.  The only significant change was:
   * **Type checker now respects a variable's declared type**.  Previously, the declared type was ignored as discussed [here](http://whiley.org/2014/02/15/whiley-0-3-22-released/).


As usual, you can get the latest files below.  Furthermore, you can now run Whiley in your browser from [here](http://whiley.org/play/), whilst the [Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/Whiley/wyclipse) will be updated in the near future.
