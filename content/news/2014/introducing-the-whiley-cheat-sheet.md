title: "Introducing the Whiley Cheat Sheet!"
draft: true
---

Recently, I created a Whiley Cheat Sheet for use in our [SWEN224 course](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/ecs/study/courses/swen-224) and I thought it was useful enough to share!  The goal of the cheat sheet is to provide some simple examples to help you get going, rather than provide a comprehensive reference.  I tried to cram as much as I could onto one piece of paper ...

If you want to quickly try out some examples, head on over to [WhileyLabs](http://whileylabs.com/) where you can edit and run Whiley programs in your browser.  Finally, the cheat sheet will live under "documentation" with the other documents I'm working on.  You can also get the [latex source on GitHub](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyDocs/tree/master/WhileyCheatSheet).
