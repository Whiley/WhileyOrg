And, finally, another release of Whiley is upon us after waiting! As usual, there are a range of known issues and limitations. But, the main improvements are:
   * **Boogie Support** .  Included within the distribution is a [backend](https://github.com/Whiley/Whiley2Boogie/) for verification using [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) and [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).  This significantly improves the verification capability with Whiley.


In addition, there have been a huge number of bug fixes to all aspects of the compiler, and things are starting to look quite promising!
