I'm pretty excited to announce that I have been awarded a prestigious [Marsden Grant](http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/) to support research on the Whiley project over the next three years.  This is obviously great news for Whiley, and will go a long way towards making the project a reality.  The following Dom Post article covered the recent announcement of awards (although my project doesn't get a specific mention):

Some more information about the awarded grants is available [here](http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/awards/2011/) as well.
