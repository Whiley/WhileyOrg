Last month, the Wellington Java User Group was kind enough to invite me to give a talk on Whiley.  The talk is a general introduction to Whiley, including the syntax, some issues related to implementation and inter-operation with Java.  The talk was video and, finally, after some faffing around I've uploaded it onto YouTube here:

Anyway, enjoy!
