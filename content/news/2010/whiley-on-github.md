Well, after some persuasion, I've finally moved the Whiley code over from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net) onto [github](http://github.com).Â  The repository is here: [http://github.com/DavePearce/Whiley.](http://github.com/DavePearce/Whiley) This means you'll be able to see the compile changing right before your eyes ... joy ;)

Of course, all this means I need to learn Git now ... which will certainly take some getting used to!
