Well, I've just released another update to the Whiley compiler.  As usual, you can access this from the downloads link on the left.  This release is relatively minor, which primarily fixes a number of bugs and includes more tests.  I've also turned off full verirfication by default, since this is really not ready yet and just gets in the way.  

At the moment, I'm working on a paper discussing Whiley's flow-sensitive type system, which is why development is somewhat slowed.  I'll be back on the case soon though, and first-class functions and maps are next on the hit list ...
