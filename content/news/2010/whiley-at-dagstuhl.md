The abstracts from the Dagstuhl seminar I recently attended are now available on the [seminar site](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/portals/index.php?semnr=10152) --- there's even a photo!  The seminar was a lot of fun, and I encourage everyone who gets the chance to go along.  The idea is that you get a bunch of people together, and then brainstorm for a week whilst enjoying the German countryside. The seminar I attended was entitled "Relationships, Objects, Roles, and Queries in Modern Programming Languages", and I guess I was invited because of my work on [Relationship Aspects](https://whileydave.com/publications/pn06_aosd/).  Anyway, most people gave a short talk and/or a demo and the slides from mine can be found on the seminar site.  Slides for a fairly similar talk I gave recently at VUW can also be found [here](/files/2010/VUWSeminar2010.ppt).
