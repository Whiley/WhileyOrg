This is a slightly quicker release than usual, with only a few relatively minor fixes and refactorings, etc:
   * Factored JVM Bytecode library into a separate project, called Jasm

   * Various bug fixes mostly related to verification.Â  See [here](https://github.com/DavePearce/Whiley/issues?milestone=12&state=closed) for the complete list.


I've also been working quite a lot on the [Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/DavePearce/wyclipse), and will be releasing an updated version of this shortly.
