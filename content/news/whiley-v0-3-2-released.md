Well, another release was long overdue!!!  This one includes lots and lots of bug fixes, particularly to the type system, and support for dictionaries (aka maps) is now in place.   Also, the language has been split in two parts: the base language (flow-sensitive + structural typing), and the extended langauge (which includes constraint checking).  Currently, the constraint checking is non-operational, but the base language works very well and there are a number of nice examples in the "examples/" directory.
