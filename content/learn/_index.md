# Learn

Having [installed](../install) Whiley, you can run your first program like so:

```
> wy init
> wy build
> wy run
Hello World
```

You should see the Whiley source file `src/main.whiley` is created,
along with the `wy.toml` build file.

## Examples

There are a number of (small) programs written in Whiley which provide
a useful reference:

   * **Minesweeper**. A web-based implementation of the well-known [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/DavePearce/Minesweeper.wy)
   
   * **Conway's Game of Life**. A web-based implementation of Conway's well-known [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). [[GitHub]](https://github.com/DavePearce/Conway.wy)
   
   * **LZ77 Compression / Decompression**. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/DavePearce/LZ.wy)
   
   * **Standard Library**. This is Whiley's standard library which (albeit small) is perhaps the best example of Whiley code. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/Whiley/STD.wy)

## Guides


   * **Getting Started With Whiley**.  A tutorial which walks through the basic concepts of Whiley, and provides a rudimentary introduction to verification.  [[PDF]](/pdfs/GettingStartedWithWhiley.pdf)
   
   * **Whiley Cheat Sheet**.  A quick overview of the language syntax.  [[PDF]](/pdfs/WhileyCheatSheet.pdf)
   
   * **Introduction to Verification with Whiley**. A tutorial which focuses in much more detail on verifying programs in Whiley, and the various challenges and pitfalls.  [[PDF]](https://whileydave.com/publications/PUG18_ETSS_preprint.pdf)

   * **Whiley Language Specification**.  Provides a reasonably comprehensive overview of the language.  [[PDF]](/pdfs/WhileyLanguageSpec.pdf)

## Other

A few other useful links:

   * **Discord Server**.  There is also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7TmmeU8u) which are welcome to join!
   
   * **Request for Comments (RFCs)**.  The RFC process mirrors that used by Rust, and provides interesting reading around the history of the language.  [[GitHub]](https://github.com/Whiley/RFCs/)
