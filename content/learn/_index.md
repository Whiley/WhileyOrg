Having <a href="../install">installed</a> Whiley, you can run your first program like so:

<pre>> wy init<br/>> wy build<br/>> wy run<br/>Hello World</pre>

You should see the Whiley source file <code>src/main.whiley</code> is created, along with the <code>wy.toml</code> build file.

<h2>Examples</h2>

There are a number of (small) programs written in Whiley which provide
a useful reference:

<ul>
<li><p><b>Minesweeper</b>. A web-based implementation of the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a> game. <a href="https://github.com/DavePearce/Minesweeper.wy">[Github]</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>Conway's Game of Life</b>. A web-based implementation of Conway's well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. <a href="https://github.com/DavePearce/Conway.wy">[Github]</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>LZ77 Compression / Decompression</b>. <a href="https://github.com/DavePearce/LZ.wy">[Github]</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>Standard Library</b>. This is Whiley's standard library which (albeit small) is perhaps the best example of Whiley code. <a href="https://github.com/Whiley/STD.wy">[Github]</a></p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Guides</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Getting Started With Whiley</b>.  A tutorial which walks through the basic concepts of Whiley, and provides a rudimentary introduction to verification.  <a href="/pdfs/GettingStartedWithWhiley.pdf">[PDF]</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>Whiley Cheat Sheet</b>.  A quick overview of the language syntax.  <a href="/pdfs/WhileyCheatSheet.pdf">[PDF]</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>Introduction to Verification with Whiley</b>. A tutorial which focuses in much more detail on verifying programs in Whiley, and the various challenges and pitfalls.  <a href="https://whileydave.com/publications/PUG18_ETSS_preprint.pdf">[PDF]</a></p></li>
