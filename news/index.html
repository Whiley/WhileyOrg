    Progress has slowed on Whiley now that Trimester 1 and my SWEN221 class with 220+ students has begun! Despite this, development continues with more contributions from others which is great. This release is largely a &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; and &ldquo;bug fixing&rdquo; release, rather than landing any big features.

    Finally the next release of Whiley is upon us! There are a few useful improvements in this release. In particular, compile-time verification of constraints is again functioning and can be enabled with a switch.

    Finally, it&rsquo;s time for yet another release. The main change with this release has been a reworking of the compiler framework into a more serious build system called, unsurprisingly, the Whiley Builder System (wybs).

    Well, it&rsquo;s been almost two months in the making, but here&rsquo;s the next release of Whiley. Quite of lot of changes, although there remain significant issues to resolve &mdash; particularly with the front-end.

    Well, crikey, what a long time since the last release. Things haven&rsquo;t changed a whole lot, apart from various bug fixes. Probably the most interesting update is the inclusion of reference counting of compound structures to enable in-place updates and prevent unnecessary cloning.

    Well, it&rsquo;s been a tough slog. But, finally, we have a new release of Whiley!! The main thing that&rsquo;s improved over the past few weeks is the underlying type implementation. This was causing problems before, as programs which should type-check were failing and vice-versa.

    So, it&rsquo;s that time again for another update of the Whiley compiler. Perhaps the most interesting update is that constraints are back! Admitedly, only runtime checking of constraints is back; and, there are quite a few problems with it.

    Development has continued at a fairly quick pace since the last release of Whiley. However, with the impending start of term, things are bound to slow down. Therefore, I&rsquo;m making a release now a little sooner that otherwise planned.

    After an untold number of commits, bug fixes and passing unit tests, the next version of Whiley is released!! I am trying to lock down the syntax of the language as much as possible now, although there are still a number of open issues.

    ChangeLog Separated compiler up into two main components as follows:
  The Whiley Compiler (wyc). This provides a base compiler which is responsible for parsing whiley programs, as well as type checking and constraint checking them.

    This latest update of Whiley is a somewhat minor increment over the previous. Aside from a number of bug fixes the main improvement is the inclusion of first-class functions (aka function pointers).

    Well, another release was long overdue!!! This one includes lots and lots of bug fixes, particularly to the type system, and support for dictionaries (aka maps) is now in place. Also, the language has been split in two parts: the base language (flow-sensitive + structural typing), and the extended langauge (which includes constraint checking).
