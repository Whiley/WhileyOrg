    Progress has slowed on Whiley now that Trimester 1 and my SWEN221 class with 220+ students has begun! Despite this, development continues with more contributions from others which is great. This release is largely a &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; and &ldquo;bug fixing&rdquo; release, rather than landing any big features.

    Well, it is with some trepidation that I have released the next version of Whiley. This incorporates a very large number of changes and, unfortunately, should be considered extremely unstable at this time (at least, from the perspective of verification).
