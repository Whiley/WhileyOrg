      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-39-released/</guid>
      <description>Progress has slowed on Whiley now that Trimester 1 and my SWEN221 class with 220+ students has begun! Despite this, development continues with more contributions from others which is great. This release is largely a &amp;ldquo;cleaning up&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bug fixing&amp;rdquo; release, rather than landing any big features.</description>

      <description>Finally, just over one month since the last release of Whiley, version v0.3.38 is released today! The list of changes is reasonably large and we should expect lots more going forward &amp;hellip;</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-37-released/</guid>
      <description>Another big update to Whiley landed today, and includes a whole raft of changes. In particular, various algorithms in the automated theorem prover have been reworked to improve performance (though more still needs to be done here).</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-36-released/</guid>
      <description>The next version of Whiley is upon us. Whilst predictably late, this release packs quite a punch and contains a range of changes to the language syntax, and critical updates to the verifier.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-35-released/</guid>
      <description>Finally, a release of Whiley that is on schedule! This includes some fairly significant updates to the syntax of the language itself:
  Removal of set and map data types (#471).</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-34-released/</guid>
      <description>Finally, after almost two months of effort, the next version of Whiley is released. This release has taken a long time, not because it contains so much, but simply because I have been truly busy with teaching my second year paper SWEN221.</description>

      <description>The next release of Whiley is upon us!! Work got a little bogged down with the start of term, but should hopefully now pick up a little. The main component of this release is the removal of the string and char data types from the language.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/news/whiley-v0-3-32-released/</guid>
      <description>Well, it is with some trepidation that I have released the next version of Whiley. This incorporates a very large number of changes and, unfortunately, should be considered extremely unstable at this time (at least, from the perspective of verification).</description>

      <description>The next release of Whiley is already upon us, after only a week or so since the last. This release consists of a slew of minor bug fixes, many of which have been discovered through students using the system in practice.</description>

      <description>The next release of Whiley is upon us. This includes a large number of bug fixes, and a significant rewrite of the verifier. Unfortunately, the verifier is not yet verifying many more examples, but it&amp;rsquo;s now placed to do so.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s about time for another release of Whiley. This represents some interesting developments, though I continue to struggle with debugging and improving verification. The main highlights for this release are:</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another release of the Whiley compiler. This one is fairly low key, focusing primarily on bug fixes. Specifically, these issues have been resolved:

      <description>This latest update of Whiley is a somewhat minor increment over the previous. Aside from a number of bug fixes the main improvement is the inclusion of first-class functions (aka function pointers).</description>
