      <description>And, after a long while, another official release of Whiley is here. This is something of an interim release whilst other things are brewing in the background. There also some known issues with this release.</description>

      <description>The web IDE for Whiley is the easiest way to run Whiley, and it&amp;rsquo;s even better after a little face lift! Here&amp;rsquo;s the obligatory screenshot:
 You can run this on your local machine by cloning the Github repo and running ant run from the command-line.</description>

      <description>The next release is finally upon us. This one has been a long time coming, and its going to take a while before it settles down again!! Work on this release has been ongoing since February, though partial changes were released in v0.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2016/03/11/whiley-v0.3.39-released/</guid>
      <description>Progress has slowed on Whiley now that Trimester 1 and my SWEN221 class with 220+ students has begun! Despite this, development continues with more contributions from others which is great. This release is largely a &amp;ldquo;cleaning up&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bug fixing&amp;rdquo; release, rather than landing any big features.</description>

      <description>Finally, just over one month since the last release of Whiley, version v0.3.38 is released today! The list of changes is reasonably large and we should expect lots more going forward &amp;hellip;</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/12/17/whiley-v0.3.37-released/</guid>
      <description>Another big update to Whiley landed today, and includes a whole raft of changes. In particular, various algorithms in the automated theorem prover have been reworked to improve performance (though more still needs to be done here).</description>

      <description>The next version of Whiley is upon us. Whilst predictably late, this release packs quite a punch and contains a range of changes to the language syntax, and critical updates to the verifier.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/06/19/whiley-v0.3.35-released/</guid>
      <description>Finally, a release of Whiley that is on schedule! This includes some fairly significant updates to the syntax of the language itself:
  Removal of set and map data types (#471).</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/06/05/whiley-v0.3.34-released/</guid>
      <description>Finally, after almost two months of effort, the next version of Whiley is released. This release has taken a long time, not because it contains so much, but simply because I have been truly busy with teaching my second year paper SWEN221.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/04/08/whiley-v0.3.33-released/</guid>
      <description>The next release of Whiley is upon us!! Work got a little bogged down with the start of term, but should hopefully now pick up a little. The main component of this release is the removal of the string and char data types from the language.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/02/25/whiley-v0.3.32-released/</guid>
      <description>Well, it is with some trepidation that I have released the next version of Whiley. This incorporates a very large number of changes and, unfortunately, should be considered extremely unstable at this time (at least, from the perspective of verification).</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2015/01/06/looking-forward-to-2015/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s scary to think that 2014 has been and gone, and that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t released the next major version of Whiley! Despite this, I have been busy improving the compiler and language and I thought it would be helpful for me to recap what was achieved last year, and what the goals going forward are.</description>

      <description>The next release of Whiley is already upon us, after only a week or so since the last. This release consists of a slew of minor bug fixes, many of which have been discovered through students using the system in practice.</description>

      <description>The next release of Whiley is upon us. This includes a large number of bug fixes, and a significant rewrite of the verifier. Unfortunately, the verifier is not yet verifying many more examples, but it&amp;rsquo;s now placed to do so.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another release of the Whiley compiler. This one is fairly low key, focusing primarily on bug fixes. Specifically, these issues have been resolved:
  #346 &amp;mdash; Temporary Fix for Unsuported Bytecodes in the Verifier.</description>

      <description>This is a slightly quicker release than usual, with only a few relatively minor fixes and refactorings, etc:

      <description>Well, this release is about 2 months overdue, but it embodies a lot of work. The main changes are:
  Bug fixes. I&amp;rsquo;ve closed around 36 issues, many of which were intricate little bugs.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2013/05/06/whiley-v0.3.19-released/</guid>
      <description>It is with some disappointment that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to release v0.3.19 despite this being almost 3 months overdue! The disappointment arises because, despite a lot of valiant effort, verification is still not working very well &amp;mdash; and, in fact, is probably worse than the previous release!</description>

      <description>The next version of Whiley is upon us! This consists of mostly lightweight improvements over v0.3.17 and various bug fixes (see issues for more). I have now been attempting to verify some of the microbenchmarks in Wybench, with some useful progress being made (although it is flushing out a lot of issues).</description>

      <description>Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s been over three months since the last release of Whiley, this latest release is chocked full of improvements! I&amp;rsquo;ve closed around 60 issues in that time, and have completely reworked the theorem prover from scratch.</description>

      <description>Just yesterday, I came across the ohloh website for the first time and was surprised to find the Whiley project already listed there. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before, Ohloh is a site that attempts to gather stats and other information on open source projects such as: who the developers are, how many commits there are and how the line count has changed over time.</description>

      <description>With the latest release of Whiley, compile-time checking of constraints can be enabled with a command-line switch. So, I thought a few examples of this were in order.

      <description>Finally the next release of Whiley is upon us! There are a few useful improvements in this release. In particular, compile-time verification of constraints is again functioning and can be enabled with a switch.</description>

      <description>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another release. The main change with this release has been a reworking of the compiler framework into a more serious build system called, unsurprisingly, the Whiley Builder System (wybs).</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been almost two months in the making, but here&amp;rsquo;s the next release of Whiley. Quite of lot of changes, although there remain significant issues to resolve &amp;mdash; particularly with the front-end.</description>

      <description>Well, crikey, what a long time since the last release. Things haven&amp;rsquo;t changed a whole lot, apart from various bug fixes. Probably the most interesting update is the inclusion of reference counting of compound structures to enable in-place updates and prevent unnecessary cloning.</description>

      <description>As usual, it&amp;rsquo;s been a surprising amount of effort &amp;hellip; but the next release of Whiley is available! It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time since the last update, but then quite a lot has improved.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a tough slog. But, finally, we have a new release of Whiley!! The main thing that&amp;rsquo;s improved over the past few weeks is the underlying type implementation. This was causing problems before, as programs which should type-check were failing and vice-versa.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2011/08/15/whiley-v0.3.9-released/</guid>
      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s that time again for another update of the Whiley compiler. Perhaps the most interesting update is that constraints are back! Admitedly, only runtime checking of constraints is back; and, there are quite a few problems with it.</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2011/07/07/whiley-v0.3.7-released/</guid>
      <description>Development has continued at a fairly quick pace since the last release of Whiley. However, with the impending start of term, things are bound to slow down. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m making a release now a little sooner that otherwise planned.</description>

      <description>After an untold number of commits, bug fixes and passing unit tests, the next version of Whiley is released!! I am trying to lock down the syntax of the language as much as possible now, although there are still a number of open issues.</description>

      <description>Well, another release was long overdue!!! This one includes lots and lots of bug fixes, particularly to the type system, and support for dictionaries (aka maps) is now in place. Also, the language has been split in two parts: the base language (flow-sensitive + structural typing), and the extended langauge (which includes constraint checking).</description>

      <guid>https://whiley.org/2010/06/07/whiley-compiler-status-update/</guid>
      <description>So, a little update regarding the status of the Whiley compiler. I have spent a considerable amount of time redesigning the theorem prover over the last 8-12 weeks, and still haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to put everything back together.</description>
